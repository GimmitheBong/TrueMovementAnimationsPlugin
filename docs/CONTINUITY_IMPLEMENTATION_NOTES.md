# True Movement continuity implementation notes

This document records why the continuity fixes exist and the boundaries they
must preserve. It is intended to keep the rendering path understandable for
future maintainers rather than turning a set of visual fixes into a black box.

## Core design rule

The native player is authoritative for game state. The plugin only presents a
smoothed visual copy. During a scene rebuild or delayed client frame, it is
preferable for that copy to remain one visual frame behind authoritative data
than to jump, stall, reverse, or advance through collision geometry.

The continuity code must not inject input, alter the route, predict a red-click
interaction destination, or change server-visible state.

## `[TMA-CAST-MOVEMENT-ORDERING]`: casts followed by movement

### Cause

The old path had two authorities for a cast:

1. the player's live `Owner.getAnimation()` value; and
2. a delayed system which recognised selected cast/teleport animation IDs,
   stored timing flags, and later synthesized
   `HUMAN_CASTTELEPORT_REVERSE` (animation 715).

If the player clicked away during a cast, movement could start first and the
stored animation could replay afterward. That also set a teleport-style
position flag, producing a false snap or apparent teleport.

### Fix

The live player animation is authoritative immediately. The duplicate delayed
cast detector, interrupt flags, and synthetic reverse-teleport replay were
removed. Custom locomotion continues to advance in the background while the
action animation is visible, so movement can resume without replaying the cast.

This does **not** remove legitimate teleports. The generic
`bShouldTeleportToLocation` request remains for a real authoritative
discontinuity. The removed behavior was only the later, inferred cast replay.

### Maintenance invariant

Do not add a second timer which replays a cast after `Owner.getAnimation()` has
already exposed it. If a particular spell needs visual treatment, derive it
from the current authoritative animation without queuing another positional
authority.

## `[TMA-STOP-FACING]`: yellow-click stop spin

### Cause

After the visible model had reached its destination, the hidden native player
could still be catching up. Copying the native orientation during that interval
made the visible model spin while it searched for the native facing direction.

### Fix

A yellow walk click may arm a short orientation hold. Once visible movement
stops, the last visible facing is retained only while the hidden player catches
up. A red world interaction cancels that hold immediately, so NPC and object
facing remains controlled by the game.

The hold is deliberately conditional: it is not a general orientation override
and must not apply to red-click interactions.

## `[TMA-IDLE-CATCH-UP]`: smooth idle while the native player catches up

### Cause

The custom model could enter idle while its animation clock was still tied to
the hidden player's locomotion/catch-up state. Breathing and head movement then
looked accelerated or choppy, with a visible phase change when ordinary
animation smoothing resumed.

### Fix

The catch-up interval has an idle animation controller seeded from the native
idle frame. It advances on the visual frame clock, then hands its phase back
without resetting. A new click does not reuse the old catch-up controller, so
movement starts from the current displayed pose rather than producing a
one-frame jump.

## `[TMA-MOTION-CONTINUITY]`: use the last displayed state at handoff

### Cause

Local scene coordinates and `WorldView` wrapper objects are not stable across a
region rebuild. Resetting because a wrapper instance changed, or rebasing from
new local coordinates before the new scene was drawable, discarded the last
displayed position and animation phase.

### Fix

The handler retains the last rendered world tile, sub-tile offset, animation
controller, orientation, and interpolation state. Equivalent world views are
compared by their stable identity rather than Java wrapper identity. When a new
scene becomes usable, its local coordinates are derived from that retained
world-space presentation state.

This is a render handoff only. Normal movement interpolation remains the
authority after the handoff; it was intentionally not replaced with
native-delta interpolation because that caused models to overshoot interaction
tiles and cross objects.

## `[TMA-SCENE-LOAD-CONTINUITY]`: atomic scene replacement

### Cause

`RuneLiteObject` instances belong to a scene. Destroying the old object as soon
as `LOADING` began left a blank frame, while creating or rebasing the new one
later in the overlay allowed the native and custom presentations to disagree.

### Fix

- `LOADING` is a soft suspension, not a movement reset.
- A scene generation counter ensures the custom object is recreated once for
  the new scene.
- `onBeforeRender` prepares and rebases the object before native-player
  suppression is allowed for that frame.
- If preparation is not complete, the native player remains the fallback
  instead of rendering neither player.
- The new custom object starts from the last successfully displayed world
  position and sub-tile offset.

For yellow-click running at an exact outward scene edge, a small bounded
boundary bridge may preserve forward momentum until the next route point is
available. It is excluded from red-click interactions and is capped so it
cannot become route prediction or recreate the “run onto the object” bug.

## `[TMA-SCENE-PRESENTATION-CLOCK]`: pay back scene-build time gradually

### Cause

Scene logs showed that the object could be prepared roughly 180–190 ms before
its first drawable frame. Charging all of that elapsed time to the first
visible update produced an abrupt player/camera jump. Freezing the timer instead
caused a stop followed by a fast catch-up.

### Fix

The first drawable frame marks the actual presentation time. Time consumed by
scene preparation is deferred as visual time debt:

- the first recovery delta is capped at 34 ms;
- deferred time is repaid at no more than 20% of each current frame delta;
- debt is capped at 600 ms; and
- route retarget duration is lengthened to preserve the model's visible
  pre-load velocity.

This creates a gradual ease into current authoritative state. It does not
discard movement or change the route; the rendered model may simply trail it by
a small amount while continuity is restored.

## Adaptive camera continuity

The camera follows the same presented model state, expressed in pseudo-world
space across scene changes. Camera handoff uses the exact last presented
position and the same bounded frame delta. It only synchronizes to the native
player when the native player was actually the presented fallback. This avoids
using a newer native position for the camera while the visible model is still
recovering.

`[TMA-ADAPTIVE-CAMERA-VERTICAL-CONTINUITY]` applies the same continuity rule to
camera height. X/Z were already eased, but focal Y was assigned directly from
terrain and animation height every frame. Area-load traces showed a continuous
horizontal camera with `snapped=false` while focal Y changed by roughly 48-56
height units on the first destination frame. The retained last-presented focal
height now approaches the new target with an 80 ms, frame-rate-independent
half-life. Native-camera presentations refresh that retained source value, so
the easing begins from the camera the user actually saw rather than a stale
custom value.

## Diagnostics and tests

The temporary `[SceneLoadTrace]` instrumentation was used to compare scene
generation, route/local/world coordinates, model presentation, camera
presentation, and frame timing. It was removed after in-game validation so no
per-frame diagnostic formatting remains in production.

The focused tests cover:

- world/local rebasing and scene identity;
- atomic scene generation acknowledgement;
- bounded scene-edge bridging;
- scene presentation time deferral and repayment;
- recovery tween duration/velocity preservation; and
- adaptive camera handoff, delta limiting, and vertical easing.

These tests validate the rendering math and state transitions. In-game
validation is still required for visual behavior because a JVM test cannot
reproduce RuneLite's complete scene-render scheduling.
